Project's Title: My portfolio on HTML and CSS

Description:- This my first HTML and CSS project. I make my portfolio on Visual studio code.Firstly I'm going to start by creating a new HTML file, index dot HTML,
then I'm going to create a new folder.So this one is going to be storing our all of our styles inside the styles for them when to create a new style.So the extension
we're going to be using for this one is s CSS.So I'm going to set the margin to zero, because by default, the page is whenever margin and padding zero, box sizing, zero
box, actually, box and then list style to none. I use some HTML tag like div,<a>, nav, img, etc . I use lots of library code for effective styleing on my portfolio page.
Having a portfolio website has several benefits, including:it provides a platform to showcase your relevant skills and experienceit shows your personality it lets
hiring managers find you instead of you reaching out to them ,you are easily searchable on search engines like Google.

background. We will add a dark background on page scrolling later. It toggles on smaller devices

                         also displays some text in the center above the background image with the help of the above CSS.
